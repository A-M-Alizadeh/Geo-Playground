# Geo-Playground

üõ∞Ô∏è **Interactive GNSS Signal Modulation Explorer**

An educational web application for learning and experimenting with satellite navigation signal processing concepts.

## Launch From Here [Live Geo-Playground](https://a-m-alizadeh.github.io/Geo-Playground/)

## Features

- **Ranging Codes**: Generate and analyze GPS C/A codes, PRN sequences, and correlation properties
- **Carrier Modulation**: Explore BPSK, QPSK modulation with constellation diagrams and eye patterns
- **BOC Modulation**: Interactive BOC signal generation with different parameters (BOC(1,1), BOC(6,1), etc.)
- **GPS L1 Multiplexing**: Visualize how multiple GPS services share the L1 frequency band
- **Combined Signals**: Animated signal propagation from satellite to receiver
- **Modulation Playground**: Interactive learning environment with real-time parameter adjustment

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Navigate through the tabs to explore different signal concepts
3. Adjust parameters using sliders and dropdowns
4. Watch animations to understand signal processing steps

## Educational Focus

Perfect for students and professionals learning:

- GNSS signal structures
- Spread spectrum techniques
- Digital modulation principles
- Signal correlation and acquisition
- Satellite navigation fundamentals

Built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript for real-time interactive visualizations.
